List of goals for this project based on current process and desired end result
1. Fully automated process that precisely matches the current PC build process
2. Expanding on that process to include
  a. Verbose, stateful Logging
  b. End of process pass/fail visual check - e.g. a change to the desktop color, write to a common log file, powershell status update on overhead montiors, etc.
  c. Ability to run again on already prepped PC to push new apps, updates, Windoows patches and new process items e.g. update/remove common apps easily, add new patches to inventory PCs
  d. Faster update process- Ability to create local app repos and local WSUS server for Windows Updates (SPEED LAN vs. WAN)
  e. Ability to redirect to new repos on demand
  f. Ability to easily interpret and change scripts without needing a high level of programming experience (Powershell 101 is needed)
